# Technical test
 
### How to launch
#### Easy way
* `docker-compose up` and visit then localhost

#### Hard way
* Server `cd server && npm i && npm run dev` and run mongodb with default settings
* Client `cd client && npm i && npm run start`

### About
Everything made from scratch, without any help of starter packs(only mines :D)
There is a lot of things to do better, but one of requirements were to not waste more than one day.

## Room to grow for server
* Tests
* Data validations (some kind there is validations but more like business logic)
* I18n
* Add logs
* Some anti-ddos/anti-hack

## Room to grow for client
* Tests
* Add store implementation
* Use RxJS flows
